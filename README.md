# ZoomImageViewer

This repository contains code for four synchronised high-resolution image viewers, used to display high-resolution images for comparison. 

The code is designed to run in a browser, using javascript. 

To use this viewer with your own high-resolution images, replace the files in [GeneratedImages](GeneratedImages)
The images must be in Deep Zoom Image (DZI) format. High-resolution images can be converted to DZI format images using [VIPS](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) with the command ''' dzsave '''
